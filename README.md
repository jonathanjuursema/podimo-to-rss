This repository is a fork of [this](https://github.com/ThijsRay/podimo) repository, which contains code to extract a standard Podcast RSS feed.

This version of the application is distributed as a Docker container and takes the Podimo credentials as environment variables.

You can run your own instance of this application using your credentials and use the provided RSS feed in your own Podcast player.

The intent of this application is explicitly _not_ to pirate Podimo podcasts or share your Podimo account with multiple people. The intent use this in combination with your own account (or at least make sure every user has an active Podimo subscription) but allow you to use the podcasts you pay for in any RSS-compatible podcast app if you prefer that app over Podimos.

More documentation may follow later.
